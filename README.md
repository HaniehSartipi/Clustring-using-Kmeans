# Clustring-using-Kmeans
Utilized the Breast Cancer dataset, I removed the class labels and applied KMeans with four clusters. By calculating within-cluster distance for clusters ranging from 1 to 10, we determined that k=4 was optimal using the elbow method.I applied PCA to reduce dimensionality, PCA reduced noise and improved KMeans performance, especially with highly correlated variables.
